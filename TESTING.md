# Testing of Spelling game

## Use of intended audience to gain advice on how it should work

Prior to completing the coding, I asked children whether they could identify some of the images and what word they thought that they were being asked to spell. I also asked them what they would want in a game and what they wouldn't like.

The younger child liked getting a score per letter and the buy a letter function (although after starting to use this function just used that and raced through them). We discussed scores and they didn't like to have points taken off them for mistakes, buying letters or skipping words. They thought that it needed easy vs hard so that they didn't have to do the difficult words. I asked what they thought of a timer and they said it would be stressful.

The words the younger child couldn't identify from the picture and they didn't know were : pharaoh, quarter and incense. The pictures they chose a different word for were : dinosaur was T-rex and station was subway and they did get cucumber but also thought it might be a pickle. Due to their level of education I didn't ask them to try to spell any of the words that were longer than 3 letters, but they enjoyed that.

As the younger child and two of my adult testers didn't get incense I have removed this word from the list.
